Rust is a systems programming language that's fast, memory-safe, and concurrent. Here's how to get started.

## Installation

First, install Rust using rustup:

```bash,linenos
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Your First Program

Create a new file called `main.rs`:

```rust,linenos
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash,linenos
rustc main.rs
./main
```

```bash,linenos
rustc main.rs
./main
```

*Note: Rust compilation can be slow initially but produces very fast executables.*

## Key Concepts

### Ownership

Rust's ownership system is what makes it memory-safe without a garbage collector.

### Borrowing

You can borrow references to data without taking ownership.

*Note: Borrowing rules are checked at compile time, preventing many common bugs.*

## Conclusion

Rust has a learning curve, but it's worth it for the safety and performance benefits.
