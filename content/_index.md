Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Youâ€™ve stumbled upon my corner of the internet. My name is Sandesh (pronounced sun-they-shh), and I am Senior Firmware Engineer working at Marvell Semiconductor Inc. I have a MS in Computer Science from Boise State University and a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Nepal.

I like to think of myself as an engineer - I love to (try and) solve problems whenever I can. I get excited by the prospect of writing safe, clean software. I am an avid Rustacean, but I am also experimenting a lot with Modern C++ these days.

Hereâ€™s a list of my socials if you want to connect with me:

- GitHub
- LinkedIn

I am in a relationship with the very awesome Supriya. Giver her profile a visit!
