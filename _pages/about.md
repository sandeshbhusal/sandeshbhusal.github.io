Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You've stumbled upon my corner of the internet. My name is Sandesh (pronounced sun-they-shh), and I am Senior Firmware Engineer working at [Marvell Semiconductor Inc.](https://www.marvell.com/). I have a MS in Computer Science from Boise State University and a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Nepal.

I like to think of myself as an engineer - I love to (try and) solve problems whenever I can. I get excited by the prospect of writing safe, clean software. I am an avid Rustacean, but I am also experimenting a [lot](https://github.com/sandeshbhusal/irpam_cpp) with Modern C++ these days.

Here's a list of my socials if you want to connect with me:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/sandeshbhusal)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sandeshbhusal)

I am in a relationship with the very awesome [Supriya](https://supriyakhadka.com.np). Giver her profile a visit!
