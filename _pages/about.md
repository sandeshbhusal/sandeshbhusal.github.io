Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My name is Sandesh (pronounced sun-they-sh), and I am a graduate student at [Boise State University](https://bsu.edu), pursuing my MS in Computer Science. I work with computers (as you must've guessed), and like to tinker with a wide range of things, from STM32 controllers, to genetic algorithms. 

I like to think of myself as a polyglot developer - I can write code in Python, Rust, Go, C and C++ (in order of my proficiency). I am an avid Rustacean, and will probably try to convert you (be warned). Right now, I am working on a PAM authentication system to utilize IR cameras for facial recognition (in Rust).

Here's a list of my socials if you want to connect with me:

- [Email](mailto:sandeshbhusal@u.boisestate.edu)

I am in a relationship with the very awesome [Supriya](https://supriyakhadka.com.np). Giver her profile a visit!
