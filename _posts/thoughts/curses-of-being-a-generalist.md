<!-- It was a substitute teacher who first asked me the question in front of a group of my peers. I was in the 6th grade at the time, and I vividly remember the time-honored question being lobbed at me:

> _What do you want to be when you grow up?_

I can still feel that first sting of being "put on the spot"—a sensation I would come to know intimately in the years ahead.
I was in the 6th grade, and for some reason, the moment felt like a big deal - like I _had_ to make a decision then and there, and my life story would proceed in a linear fashion after that.  In that moment, it felt as though the universe had compressed itself into a single point of decision, as if my entire future hung upon the next words to leave my mouth.

"A computer engineer", I blurted out.

I had always been a tinkerer - breaking things that my dad bought to extract magnets and poking holes in bottle caps to make rubber-band-driven cars, trying to find that tweak that would make them go faster. Oh, and did I tell you ?- I was also a chemical engineer .. of sorts - making concoctions out of an assortment of weeds and leaves I fould lying around the compound of my grandma's shed, which also double-timed as my "lab". The buffaloes, nothing to do, watched my experiments with their characteristic stoic patience. Sometimes I wonder what tales they would tell of that time—would they speak of a future scientist in the making, or simply chuckle at yet another child trying to cure cancer with a mortar and pestle full of leaves?

But it was computers that truly captured my imagination. While my sisters' other textbooks gathered dust, their computer science books became my gateway to a world of perfect logic. In that realm, I found something precious: certainty. While the real world swirled with incomprehensible complexities, computers offered clarity. They did exactly what you told them to do—no more, no less. In their imperative directness, I found something approaching divinity: the power to create, to animate, to bring ideas to life one keystroke at a time.

After I was done with my school, I joined a prestigious high school in the capital, some 300 kilometers away from where I was born. My family moved temporarily, leaving behind our home for 2 years until I could be done with high school. Looking back, I realize how big of a deal that was, although it felt like something every family did. High school curriculum presented two choices - Maths+CS or Biology. Swept along by societal (and partially my family's) expectations, I chose the latter. Also -  maths scared me for no reason at all. Don't get me wrong - I was not _bad_ at maths - I would understand the concepts just fine. It was always the execution that went wrong. A missed minus here, a forgotten number there, and lo and behold! 10 points off.

Biology, on the other hand, flowed naturally, perhaps because my sisters' endless recitations had planted those seeds years before. I excelled, graduating with a gold medal at the top of my class. Once again, I faced that eternal question: What did I want to be?

And somehow, across the years, that sixth-grader's impulsive answer still rang true.

Dear reader, this, is where the story begins.

I joined Pulchowk Campus, with a rank of 172 out of some 15,000 kids that appeared for the entrance examination. I vividly remember being sad the day the results came out - I got into the top engineering school but I would not get a scholarship if I wanted to pursue Computer Engineering. Everything else was okay. This stung. Begrudgingly, I chose Computer Engineering, even if my parents had to pay for my education. I felt a need to somehow "prove" myself to myself -- affirm that I was good enough to be studying amidst these smart kids (many of whom would later come to shape the person I am now in life, and become very close friends) and justify my parents spending some ~$3000 for 4 years' of my education (remember, the PCI in Nepal was ~800 USD at the time). I learned things at a breakneck speed, doing everything. I built neural networks from scratch, after being inspired by a friend who made a RL game-playing bot. I learned how to make android apps (and one got acquired!). I learned how to make javascript talk to a backend, made websites, wrote a high-altitude balloon payload on a Arduino board, sent it to Mexico, etc. Basically I did everything there was to do. And then some more. And as you can expect, my grades tanked.

I realized if I wanted to go to grad school, this would not hold. Then came this swivel in my life -- I can only term it as such -- where I _totally_ stopped doing anything. At all. Period. It was not like I was studying all the time - I was not doing _anything_. I used to fill my empty days with programming or learning new stuff, but even that died out. Somehow, I felt like I no longer had that spark in me to do anything. I would pick some project up, and after a while feel like "what's the point?" 

I had zero soft skills - outside of my close friend circle and people I knew, I could barely initiate a conversation or keep one going, and I somehow felt like I knew everything there was to know about computers (and oh boy was I wrong). This profound realization (stupidity) led me to decide - "I'm leaving CS forever, and going to do some people business". Don't get me wrong - I do not mean .. ahem .. trafficking. Just more soft-skills-heavy-trade. While the world was reeling in the agony of COVID-19, an opportunity presented itself. A "Presales Engineering" position at Logpoint, one of the _top_ tech companies in Nepal. The stars had aligned. The universe had spoken. Your boy would become a tux-wearing-party-going-hands-shaking-product-selling presales engineer. Except the reality was so far detached from that (I went to exactly _one_ "presales" event in my career).

I joined the Presales team in September of 2020. The team was super good, and I feel like Basu dai left a lasting impression on me of what a "Manager" is supposed to be like. The rest of the team was very good to me, and we got along very well. Unlike my expectations, Presales engineering was much more about showcasing the product capabilities and molding it into the shape and size that fits the customers' expectations. This meant _using_ Logpoint, not _developing_ or _selling_ it. Most of my time was spent trying to debug setup issues (decode base64, read logs, etc.) and write regex. A whole lot of regex. Somehow people came to me asking help with regexes (which, I later realized, was not because I was good at it - it was because no-one else wanted to do it, and praising my regex-fu would make me do it - gullible much?) and I helped them. Life was chugging along. But something was just not right.

I was in a rut.

I had choices I could make to get out of it. And after a brief talk with Basu dai, I decided to transfer to the Support and Solutions department at Logpoint. -->
